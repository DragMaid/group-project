## 🧭 Coding Standards

This guide includes **coding standards tailored to each role** to ensure high code quality and maintainability. These standards cover:

- Naming conventions
- Directory structure
- Test coverage expectations
- Language-specific best practices

There are also **shared standards** that apply to **all roles**, including:

### ✅ Git Commit Standards

All team members must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard:

**Examples:**

- `feat(auth): add JWT-based login system`
- `fix(api): handle 500 error when user ID is missing`
- `chore(ci): update node version in build pipeline`

## 🔄 Agile Scrumban Framework

Our team follows a **Scrumban** methodology—a hybrid of Scrum and Kanban—to balance structure with flexibility.

### Key Features:

- **Weekly Planning Meetings**: Define sprint goals and prioritize tasks.
- **Work-In-Progress (WIP) Limits**: Prevent overload by capping active tasks.
- **Daily Standups**: Quick sync-ups to align the team and resolve blockers.
- **Continuous Delivery**: Ship features incrementally without strict sprint deadlines.
- **Retrospectives**: Reflect and improve after every release cycle.

This framework empowers the team to iterate quickly while maintaining a sustainable workflow.
